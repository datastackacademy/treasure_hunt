    "We know that for each of the encrypted messages in the trail of clues, the culprit used the [Vigenere cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). The Vigenere cipher takes a string of letters as a key to encrypt a message, and can decrypt it using that same key. In today's mystery the Vigenere cipher is used three times, each with a different key and a different message. "
